==============

My Arch Linux 64bit Install 'Template'; A collection of scripts to ease the pain ;-)
I do not know that this sick obsession these days with Open Source developers having to take a great thing, and f**k it all up by making stupid and retarded changes. KDE with 4.0, Ubuntu with Unity, GNOME 3, Rhythmbox, Amarok, and now... Arch Linux goes and removes the perfectly fine Installation Framework (AIF) and decided to replace it with some shell scripts... WTF?!?? Really??!?? Anyways, I'm not going to take this lying down... This repo will represent a semi automated way to get Arch Linux installed, obviously this will be a work in progress and I hope one that has a short life, with the hope the Arch Linux devs will pull their heads out of their backsides and give us a real installer again. This is obviously personalized to my needs, and very specific to my environment, but you may feel free to take this work and it's overall 'framework' and tailor it to your desired flavor..
This collection of scripts is made available under the terms of the WTFPL License and comes without warranty, if you blow up your system using this, I'll probably just laugh at you. Because I'm a pretentious jerk like that ;-)
